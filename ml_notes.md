### Feature/Activation Map
- Feature map is the same as activation map: $a_i = \sigma(z_i)$

### Global Average Pooling (GAP)
- Compute the average of every channel of the previous layer ($n$-channels: $32 \times 32$), then get a GAP layer       ($n$-channels: $1 \times 1$)

### Sørensen–Dice coefficient (DSC)
- A statistic to gauge the similarity of two sets $A$ and $B$:
$$\frac{2|A \cap B|}{|A| + |B|}$$
