### ***[Topological approaches to skin disease image analysis](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8622175)***

- **persistent homology**
- Utilize homology to
  1. Find a segmentation mask without training (in the grey image)
  2. Apply this mask to RGB resp. and compute the **persistence curves**, **persistence statistics**, and **persistence entropy**. Then train a **SVM** by these data.
